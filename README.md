# CharNet
 A generative neural network for artificial text and character generation

### General
CharNet is a [multilayer perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) network using a feed-forward network where each layer receives all previous layers as inputs. <br>
CharNet acts as a humanly-readable example to show improvements compared to common multilayer perceptron models and RNNs for sequential data. <br>
Various parameters are supported, most of them being switches, you can try to configure your own model. <br>
To get started, clone this repository, import the charnet and execute it with your configuration. For a more in-depth tutorial, you can also follow the notebook in [here](https://github.com/ClashLuke/CharNet/blob/master/CharNet_Notebook.ipynb) or execute the notebook using a Cloud-GPU at Google Colaboratory.
